        <h2>Fulfillment Policy</h2>
        <p>
            This Fulfillment Policy outlines the terms, conditions, and procedures governing the services provided by <strong>WorkHub</strong>. By using the WorkHub platform, users agree to comply with the policies described below.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Scope of Services</h2>
        <p>
            WorkHub is a digital job portal that connects job seekers and employers. The platform provides services such as job postings, job applications, employer branding, recruitment tools, and related digital services.
        </p>
        <p>
            All services provided on WorkHub are offered as part of a frontend prototype for demonstration purposes and may be improved or expanded in future development phases.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Service Delivery</h2>
        <p>
            Service delivery on WorkHub is primarily digital and occurs immediately after user actions. Examples include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access to job listings after account registration</li>
            <li>Submission of job applications through the platform</li>
            <li>Activation of employer dashboards and recruitment tools</li>
            <li>Display of featured or promoted job listings (where applicable)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Timelines</h2>
        <p>
            Most services on WorkHub are delivered instantly or within a short time frame. Typical timelines include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Account creation: Immediate</li>
            <li>Job posting publication: Immediate or within 24 hours</li>
            <li>Application submission confirmation: Immediate</li>
            <li>Employer access to applicants: Immediate after application submission</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Any delays caused by technical issues will be communicated to users where possible.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Payments, Pricing, and Billing</h2>
        <p>
            WorkHub may offer paid services such as featured job listings, premium employer accounts, or promotional services. Pricing details and payment providers will be introduced and clearly communicated at a later stage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Payment systems, including mobile money options, are implemented as a prototype and do not process real financial transactions at this stage.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Refunds and Cancellations</h2>
        <p>
            Since WorkHub services are digital, refunds and cancellations are handled under the following conditions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Refunds may be considered if a paid service fails to activate due to system errors.</li>
            <li>No refunds will be issued for services that have already been fully delivered.</li>
            <li>Users may request cancellation of future services before activation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All refund or cancellation requests must be submitted through the official WorkHub contact channels.
        </p>

        <h2>6. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>
            Users are responsible for providing accurate information on their profiles, job postings, and applications. WorkHub is not responsible for:

            <li>Incorrect applicant information</li>
            <li>Employment decisions made by employers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
            WorkHub acts as a connection platform and does not guarantee employment outcomes or hiring success. The platform is not liable for disputes between job seekers and employers.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Policy Updates</h2>
        <p>
            WorkHub reserves the right to update or modify this Fulfillment Policy at any time. Users will be notified of significant changes where applicable.
